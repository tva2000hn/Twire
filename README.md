# Twire

This is a fork of the [Pocket Plays for Twitch](https://github.com/SebastianRask/Pocket-Plays-for-Twitch) Android application.  
I forked the original app because I wanted a full FLOSS Twitch app, more information [in this issue](https://github.com/SebastianRask/Pocket-Plays-for-Twitch/issues/1).

Twire is an open source, ad free Twitch browser and stream player for Android.
